# Todo Tasks

My personal, todo list application which I use to plan my general day.

 * 100% client-side, nothing is stored on the server.
 * As it's browser storage, it's per machine which means I can seperate my work and personal lists.
 
Available at [https://todo.less3.com](https://todo.less3.com)
 
![Deployment](https://github.com/stephenyu/todo/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg?branch=master)

 * Future Features
   * Encypt data, so it can't be read on browser.
